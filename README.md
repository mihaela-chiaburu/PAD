# PAD

*Lab 1 - This application is a simple messaging agent that enables real-time communication between multiple users. It is implemented in two versions: the first uses sockets to establish direct client-server communication for message exchange, while the second leverages gRPC to provide a more structured and efficient interaction between components. The goal is to demonstrate different approaches to building distributed messaging systems.*
