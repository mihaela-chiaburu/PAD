*Lab 1 - This application is a simple messaging agent that enables real-time communication between multiple users. It is implemented in two versions: the first uses sockets to establish direct client-server communication for message exchange, while the second leverages gRPC to provide a more structured and efficient interaction between components. The goal is to demonstrate different approaches to building distributed messaging systems.*

*Lab 2 - The developed application is a proxy server with concurrent HTTP request processing, acting as an intermediary between the client and warehouse nodes. It manages data distribution using standard HTTP methods, while implementing caching mechanisms to improve response times and load-balancing strategies to evenly distribute workload across available servers.*
